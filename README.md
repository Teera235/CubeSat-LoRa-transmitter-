CubeSat-LoRa-Transmitter
This repository presents the development of a LoRa-based communication system tailored for CubeSat missions. The project focuses on utilizing LoRa (Long Range) modulation technology to facilitate low-power, long-range data transmission, suitable for small satellite applications.

Project Overview
The CubeSat-LoRa-Transmitter project aims to design and implement a communication system that enables CubeSats to transmit telemetry and sensor data to ground stations using LoRa technology. This approach leverages the benefits of LoRa's long-range capabilities and low power consumption, making it ideal for small satellite platforms with limited energy resources.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

IMU_UI: Interface for displaying data from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).

NGIMU-Pico2W-LoRa-Sender: Firmware for the ESP32-based LoRa transmitter.

R4-LoRa-Receiver: Firmware for the LoRa receiver module.
